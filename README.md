This thing does excatly what you think. Converst images to ascii art images.

# Usage

1. Navigate to the directory of the main.py file in command promt.
2. Type `python main.py INPUT_PATH STYLE`
3. The input path should be the path to your input image. 
4. The style must be a number 1 - 5. This how many different symbols the program uses. Bigger number = less different symbols. I usually use 4.
5. And there. The program takes 10 seconds to 1 minute depending on the resolution of input image to make the final output.
6. The output should appear in the same folder with the name "output.png".
